## We are making some changes

A [big change](https://github.com/mui/mui-toolpad/discussions/1748) is coming: we're making Toolpad focus much more on integrating with your IDE, while providing the ease of building UI fast with a drag and drop.

## Notice

MUI Toolpad is in its alpha stages of development. Feel free to run this application for testing purposes, but keep in mind, in no way is it ready or suitable to run it in production. It's both lacking in features and stability.

## Quick setup locally

**NOTE: MUI Toolpad is in preview, do not run this in production.**

Run:

```sh
npx create-toolpad-app my-app
# or
yarn create toolpad-app my-app
# or
pnpm create toolpad-app my-app
```
