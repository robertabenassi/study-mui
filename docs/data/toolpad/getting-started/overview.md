## Advantages of Toolpad

- **Build faster than ever before:** measure your development time in minutes rather than hours or daysâ€”simply drag and drop the components you need.
- **Extensible with code:** build low-code with pro-code extensibility. You can write JavaScript anywhere in Toolpad as soon as you feel limited by the built-in features.
- **Connect your data:** Toolpad lets you return data right from serverside functions which can be automatically connected to components on the page.

## Toolpad terminology

- **Explorer**: where you can define and manage pages and other project objects.
- **Component library**: where you can find components to drag and drop onto the Canvas.
- **Canvas**: where you build the UI for your application.
- **Inspector**: where you can inspect and modify properties of selected elements in the canvas.
